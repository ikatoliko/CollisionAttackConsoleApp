# CollisionAttackConsoleApp (C++)
Generation of messages and searching for collisions of its hashes.

For educational purpose.

NOTE: The hashing library (hash-library) is NOT mine. It was created by Stephan Brumme and all rights to that library go to him. I only made slight changes to namespace function names so more than one .cpp file can be included in the main .cpp file without confilcts.
